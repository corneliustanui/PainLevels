# PSI's *Shiny Apps For Schools*] Entry App

This [small shiny app](https://corneliuskiplimo.shinyapps.io/PainLevels/) represents my submission for the entry as a volunteer developer for the PSI schools outreach program.

With a colorful interface suitable for a young audience (14 years), the app demonstrates the following functions;

-   Simulate some data from a Normal distribution (representing a pain score in a clinical trial).
-   The user can choose the sample size (number of patients), mean score and variability (standard deviation).
-   Display the raw data in an engaging way for a young student.
-   Enable the user to view a histogram, so students can discuss how this changes when they vary the sample size, mean and variability.
